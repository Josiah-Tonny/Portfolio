                    Looking back on my leadership journey, I realise that some of the most powerful learning experiences aren't the ones I anticipated. They were the moments when I was pushed outside my comfort zone when I had to step up, make decisions, and take responsibility not just for myself, but for others, especially during group work. These experiences, both challenging and rewarding, have shaped the kind of leader I am becoming and helped me connect theory to practice in a personal and meaningful way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First and foremost, one of the most transformative experiences during my externship semester was working in Nairobi Skills Immersion. This experience changed my perspective about teamwork and also brought me a sense of belonging to a community, hence shaping my views on collaboration as well as communication. I was tasked with coordinating and holding an outreach for diverse groups of people from different backgrounds, each with different strengths, communication styles, and expectations. Initially, I led by doing and taking on most of the work myself and hoping others would follow. But I quickly learned that leadership isn't about doing everything; it's about empowering others to contribute. I had to develop active listening skills, delegate effectively, and build trust within the team. This experience has taught me how to create space for collaboration and highlight the importance of mutual respect and shared responsibility. It was transformative, nevertheless and also valuable.

                <div class="callout">
                    <div class="callout-title">Key Insight</div>
                    <p class="mb-0">Leadership isn't about doing everything; it's about empowering others to contribute.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Throughout my academic journey, I've had multiple opportunities to apply leadership theories in real-life contexts. During the aforementioned project, in the Implementation of AI to Agriculture in Siaya, Kenya. I drew from transformational leadership theory, particularly the importance of articulating a clear vision and motivating others. I also applied situational leadership theory, adjusting my approach based on each team member's readiness and needs. The theoretical frameworks transformed into practical tools have empowered me to lead with empathy, fostering adaptability and cultivating strategic awareness in my leadership approach.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reflecting on my growth, I have seen a clear shift in how I approach both leadership and learning. At first, I viewed leadership primarily as a title or role or an inheritance. Now, I understand it as a continuous practice rooted in self awareness, relational intelligence, and a commitment to learning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My ability to communicate has really improved; I feel so much more self-assured now. I've also gotten better at handling situations where things aren't clear-cut, and I'm much more open to hearing what others have to say. Plus, I'm more aware of my role in a group. I've learned that being a leader isn't always about being the one in charge; it's often about creating an environment where everyone can do their best work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This evolution is documented in the artefacts included in my portfolio: group project reports showcasing collaborative outcomes, peer feedback summaries highlighting my areas of strength and growth, leadership philosophy statements that articulate my values, and reflective journals that have captured my personal development. These artefacts serve as tangible evidence of my journey navigating the leadership world, offering insights into both my accomplishments and the lessons learned from setbacks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Importantly, these insights are deeply connected to my postgraduation goals. I'm passionate about creating environments where individuals feel seen, heard, and empowered whether in workplaces, educational settings, or communities. My leadership experiences has strengthened my desire to pursue a career in organizational development or human centered consulting, Psychology, where I can support others in their growth while continuing to evolve as a leader myself. I aspire to help build inclusive, learning-oriented cultures where leadership is a shared and collective process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ultimately, this journey has helped me clarify not only what I want to do but how I want to show up in the world. Leadership, for me, is no longer about having all the answers or being the loudest voice in the room. It's about listening deeply, adapting thoughtfully, and acting with integrity and inclusivity. That's the kind of leader I strive to be and this journey has helped me take meaningful steps in that direction.
